<h2>Faceted Search with Elasticsearch</h2>

<h3>What is this all about?</h3>

This is a MVC 4 Visual Studio 2013 project using Twitter Bootstrap to showcase a basic faceted search UI.
It'll get you started with a typical search and solve some of the most common problems like paging, filtering and hit highlighting:

To simplyfy things you don't need any kind of database - sample data is included as plain JSON text file.
