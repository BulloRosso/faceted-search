<h2>Faceted Search with Elasticsearch and C#/NEST</h2>

<h3>What is this all about?</h3>

<p>This is a MVC 4 Visual Studio 2013 project using Twitter Bootstrap to showcase a basic faceted search UI.</p>

<p>It'll get you started with a typical search and solve some of the most common problems like paging, filtering and hit highlighting:</p>

To simplyfy things you don't need any kind of database - sample data is included as plain JSON text file.

<h3>Components / Dependencies</h3>
<ul>
<li>Elasticsearch search engine</li>
<li>Twitter Bootstrap 3</li>
<li>Nest Wrapper for Elasticsearch</li>

</ul>

<h3>Installing Elasticsearch</h3>

<a href="http://www.elasticsearch.org/download/">Download</a> and install elasticsearch. You don't have to configure anything - just start <code>/bin/elasticsearch.bat</code> and the elasticsearch engine starts to listen on its default port 9200. This port is preconfigured in the Visual Studio Project.

<h3>Overview</h3>

Elasticsearch is somewhat similar to mongoDB: both are self contained applications which don't require much administrative efforts (from a developer's perspective). So for example you don't have to set up users or databases before running the Visual Studio Project.

While we'd be able to send/receive plain JSON data structures to communicate with the elasticsearch engine we'll make use of the Nest project: Nest is a fluent wrapper for elasticsearch and allows us to use LINQ or C#-Types without too much hassle with technical details.

<h3>Demo Domain Data</h3>

You can search blog entries of different languages which are assigned to several topics (like "Fashion &amp; Lifestyle", "Music &amp; Entertainment").

<h3>Drilldown strategies</h3>

After entering one or more search terms in the search box elasticsearch returns a rich set of results. By using aggregations (elasticsearchs facets on steroids) different options to narrow the results are available:

<ul>
   <li>Language of the blog article</li>
   <li>Topic of the blog article</li>
   <li>Date the blog article was created</li>
</ul>

Depending on the problem domain you can choose between one of the following drilldown strategies:

<ol>
    <li><strong>Adaptive facets</strong><br/>
    Each choice will lead to a new resultset and all facets will be calculated upon the new results. By using this
    approach it is ensured there is always at least one result in the result set. 
    </li>
   <li><strong>Checkbox facets</strong><br/>
Each choice will lead to a new resultset but the initial facets will remain unchanged. This strategy will enable
the user to create OR queries like "all articles in english OR french language" - but it's easy to end up with the
dreaded "no blog articles matched you search criteria" screen.
</li>
</ol>
